## Overview
This project aims to develop a Stock Price Forecasting System that uses machine learning models to predict future stock prices and generate actionable trading recommendations. The application integrates various models such as Prophet, Linear Regression (LR), and XGBoost to forecast stock prices based on historical data. In addition to stock price predictions, the system also generates buy/sell recommendations with fixed targets and stop-loss levels.

The project integrates real-time financial data through the Yahoo Finance API and TradingView widgets for visualizing live stock prices, historical trends, and technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD). The application supports different time frames for stock price analysis and provides forecasting accuracy metrics for different models.

## Features
#### Stock Price Forecasting: Predicts stock prices for the next 30 days using multiple models.
#### Buy/Sell Recommendations: Provides actionable trading advice, including buy/sell points, target prices, and stop-loss levels.
#### Real-Time Data Fetching: Retrieves real-time financial data and stock prices using yfinance and TradingView.
#### Multiple Timeframes: Supports various timeframes for stock analysis, including 1m, 5m, 1h, 1d, 1wk, and 1mo.
Interactive Visualizations: Uses Plotly to display live stock price charts, moving averages, and technical analysis indicators like RSI and MACD.
Model Accuracy Metrics: Displays the forecast accuracy of each machine learning model used.
Technical Analysis: Includes technical indicators and overlays them on the price chart.
